  <h2>üçù My Favourite Bolognese</h2>
  <p>This was always my birthday dinner request growing up ‚Äî and honestly, it‚Äôs still right up there. It‚Äôs rich, hearty, and packed with flavour thanks to a slow simmer and plenty of sneaky veg. I usually cook one batch of pasta when I make it, and another when I heat up the leftovers ‚Äî because yes, it‚Äôs even better the next day.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>A splash of extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>2 brown onions, peeled and chopped</li>
    <li>1 kg beef mince</li>
    <li>1 tsp sea salt</li>
    <li>10 grinds freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
    <li>140 g tomato paste</li>
    <li>4 √ó 400 g cans crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 large carrot, peeled and chopped</li>
    <li>12 white mushrooms, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 large handful of spinach (fresh or frozen)</li>
    <li>2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>1 cube of beef stock</li>
    <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
    <li>Parmesan cheese, grated, for serving</li>
    <li>2 √ó 500 g packs of spaghetti<br>
      <em>(I cook one with the sauce and save the other for leftovers)</em>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Method:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Start the base:</strong> In a large saucepan, heat a splash of olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and garlic, and cook for 5‚Äì7 minutes until the onions are soft and lightly golden.</li>
    <li><strong>Brown the beef:</strong> Add the mince and cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until evenly browned. Season with salt and black pepper.</li>
    <li><strong>Saut√© the veg:</strong> In a separate pan, heat a little more olive oil and add the mushrooms and carrots. Cook for 5‚Äì7 minutes until softened and just starting to caramelise.</li>
    <li><strong>Bring it together:</strong> Add the saut√©ed veg to the beef mixture, then stir in the tomato paste and let it simmer for a few minutes. Add the crushed tomatoes, spinach, Worcestershire sauce, beef stock cube, and sugar. Mix everything together well.</li>
    <li><strong>Let it simmer:</strong> Reduce the heat to low and simmer uncovered for 1‚Äì2 hours, stirring occasionally. The sauce should thicken and develop a rich, deep flavour.</li>
    <li><strong>Cook your pasta:</strong> When ready to serve, cook one batch (500 g) of spaghetti according to the packet instructions. Save the second batch for leftovers later in the week.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve & store:</strong> Toss your spaghetti with a generous ladle of sauce, top with parmesan cheese, and enjoy. Leftovers keep beautifully for a few days and freeze well too.</li>
